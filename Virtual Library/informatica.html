			 <h2> HTML5 for Web Designers </h2> 
				<p> HTML5 is the longest HTML specification ever written. It is also the most powerful, and in some ways,
				the most confusing. What do accessible, content-focused standards-based web designers and front-end developers 
				need to know? And how can we harness the power of HTML5 in today's browsers? HTML5 isn't as confusing as it once 
				was, but it still isn't straightforward. It's an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, change in the ongoing 
				story of markup and if you're currently creating websites with any version of HTML, you're already using HTML5. </p>

			 <h2> The Algorithm Design Manual  </h2> 
				<p> This book is intended as a manual on algorithm design, providing access to combinatorial algorithm technology for both
				students and computer professionals. Designing correct, efficient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires
				access to two distinct bodies of knowledge: • Techniques – Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental algorithm design
				techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming, depth first search, backtracking, and heuristics. Perhaps the single most
				important design technique is modeling, the art of abstracting a messy real-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic
				attack. • Resources – Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants. </p>

			 <h2> Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++, Third Edition </h2> 
				<p> A comprehensive treatment focusing on the creation of efficient data structures and algorithms, this text explains how to select
				or design the data structure best suited to specific problems. It uses C++ as the programming language and is suitable for second-year 
				data structure courses and computer science courses in algorithmic analysis. </p>

			 <h2> Advances in Graph Algorithms </h2> 
				<p> This is a book about some currently popular topics such as exponential algorithms, fixed-parameter algorithms and algorithms using
				decomposition trees of graphs. Especially for this last topic the authors found it necessary to include a chapter on graph classes.After
				each chapter we included some basic exercises. For experienced students these exercises are probably too easy. We made the decision to
				concentrate on elementary exercises in order not to distract the student too much from the main topics. The exercises are primarily meant
				as a check for the students that they understand the material of the chapter. </p>

			 <h2> Introduction to Design Analysis of Algorithms  </h2> 
				<p> This book was very useful to easily understand the algorithms. This book is having enough examples on every algorithm. It has written
				for the sake of students to provide complete knowledge on Algorithms. </p>
